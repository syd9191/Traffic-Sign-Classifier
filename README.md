## Instructions

1. **Install Requirements**
   - Use the following command to install all necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Download Models**
   - Download the pre-trained models and image Dataset from the provided Google Drive link:
     [Google Drive - Models and Image Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zAgRTRNzlkOubOKzDlF99UdJUOqatqKq?usp=sharing)

3. **Dataset Setup**
   - Ensure the images dataset is placed in the parent directory. The folder structure should look like this:
